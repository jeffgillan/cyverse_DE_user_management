# CyVerse Discovery Environment User Management

<br/>
<br/>

## Subscription (Basic, Pro, Commercial) & Quota (CPU & Storage limits)

In the [Cyverse Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org) Admin tab>>>Subscriptions tab, you can change the plan and quotas for each individual user.   


<br/>
<br/>

## Give Service Access (eg. VICE Apps) to Individual Users
In the [User Portal](https://user.cyverse.org), go to the Administrative >> _Users_ menu. You can look up any Cyverse user and add the _Services_ (e.g., DE Vice) they can access. 

<br/>
<br/>

## Give Service Access (eg. VICE Apps) to Groups

In the [User Portal](https://user.cyverse.org), go to the Administrative >> _Workshops_ menu. You can add _Services_ (e.g. DE Vice) that all workshop enrollees will inherent. For groups like ESIIL that are trying to track usage, this is the best practice for being able to easily pull together usage metrics. There already exists a few Workshops related to ESIIL including _ESIIL Users_, _ESIIL Innovation Summit 2025_, and others.

## Sharing Folders, Apps, and Tools with Groups

In the [Cyverse Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org) _Teams_ tab, you can add multiple users to a custom Team. Then you can share folders, apps, and tools with this team. 


<br/>

_Collections_ is another way to group users and share apps with them.
