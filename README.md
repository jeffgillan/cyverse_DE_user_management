## User Portal

User portal is at [https://user.cyverse.org/](https://user.cyverse.org). 

#### Users
In the _Users_ menu, you can look up any Cyverse user and add the _Services_ (e.g., DE Vice) they can access. 

#### Workshops
For groups like ESIIL that are trying to track usage, best practices is make sure each user is in an ESIIL _Workshop_. You can add _Services_ (e.g. DE Vice) that all workshop enrollees will inherent. 

## Discovery Environment User Management
#### Admin >> Subscriptions
This is where you can specify the Subscription for each user (Basic, Pro, Commercial) and specify the cpu hours and storage limits. 

## Teams
Teams allow you to create, organize, and join public or private groups of collaborators. **You can share apps or tools with Teams, but not data.**

Any teams you are a member of will show up under "My Teams". Find other public teams that you can join by selecting "All Teams".

You can create your own Team and define Team members and Team privileges by selecting "Create Team".
